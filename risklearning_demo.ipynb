    "Most, if not all, operational risk capital models assume the existence of stationary frequency and severity distributions (typically Poisson for frequencies, and a subexponential distribution such as lognormal for severities). Yet every quarter (or whenever the model is recalibrated) risk capital goes up almost without fail, either because frequencies increase, severities increase or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of stationary distributions is just one limitation of current approaches to operational risk modeling, but it offers a good inroad for modeling approaches beyond the usual actuarial model typical in operational capital models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we give a first example of how neural networks can overcome the stationarity assumptions of traditional approaches. The hope is that this is but one of many examples showing a better way to model operational risk."
